Simple Payments Service
=======================

This Flask project is intended as a dummy payment service for educational use.
The service is used in Aalto Web Software Development course as part of a ecommerce site project.
It is similar to real online payment services, but intended merely to give students an idea how such a service can be used.

This project uses same payment service API as it's predecessor:

* `updated Django simple-payments <https://github.com/teemulehtinen/simple-payments>`_ (updated 2015)
* `original Django simple-payments <https://github.com/vkaravir/simple-payments>`_ (updated 2012)

If you are a student of the course, it's recommended to read the source code of above Django projects instead.
